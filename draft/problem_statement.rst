Problem statement
=================

Data management is a broad term and it means different things to different
people. At a very high level funders and the research community as a whole
cares about data being trusted, shared and reusable [`FAIR data REF
<https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618>`_, `Effective research data REF
<https://www.elsevier.com/connect/10-aspects-of-highly-effective-research-data>`_.
At an intermediate level research institutes and project leaders need to think
about the life cycle of data [`Data management plan REF
<http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004525>`_].
Whereas at the ground level individual researchers need to think about how to
structure their data into files, how these data files are organised and how to
associate metadata with these data files [`Digital Data Storage REF
<http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005097>`_,
`Tidy Data REF <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html>`_, `Leek data
sharing REF <http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html>`_.

Although the high level goals of data management such as making data Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable and Rusable [`FAIR data REF
<https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618>`_] are admirable they are at this
point in time very difficult to reach for anyone other than organisations dedicated to
hosting scientific data [`Effective research data REF
<https://www.elsevier.com/connect/10-aspects-of-highly-effective-research-data>`_].
One reason for this is that there is a lack of tooling even for basic data management
at the level of research institutes, research groups and individual researchers.

Another reason data management is difficult at the ground level is that there
is little incentive for the people generating the data, most commonly PhD
students and post-docs, to care about data management.

Our strategy to data management at the JIC is therefore to provide light weight
tooling that solves problems of the people generating and analysing data that
results in better data management as a side-effect rather than as the primary goal.
