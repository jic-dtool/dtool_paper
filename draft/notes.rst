* Comment on fact that data management is a very broad term, useful to explain the various components of 
  data management and what it means to different people and different scales of organisation/operation and
  granularity at which you're talking (files vs. collections of files vs. all collections of files in the world
  for particular type of data).
* Clearly specify the *particular* problem(s) that our tool solves (incentives to organise, better processing)
* For the scientist wanting to make a discovery, data mangement is not an end goal in and of itself, although
  consuming other peoples' data may be an important tool/method. We therefore have the goal of incentivising 
  individual scientists to mangage their data better
* Fear of not being reproducible isn't tangible until the journal editors are accusing you of fiddling your data
* Scientist has the information, institution/funder has the incentive, we have the tool
* Discuss importance of group leader in discussion?
* Brainstorm beautiful infographics!

Infographic ideas
=================

* Package our data into a beautiful box
* The box is self contained and verifiable
* The box fits into processing pipelines
* The box is locatable in among lots of boxes
* The box can be moved around
